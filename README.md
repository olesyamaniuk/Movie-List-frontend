Task:
Develop a full-fledged web application for managing a list of movies that users have
watched, plan to watch, or have added to their favorites. The application should be
implemented using React on the frontend, Node.js and Express on the backend, and a
database (e.g., MongoDB).
Application Functionality:
➔ Movie List:
◆ Display a list of movies with details such as image, title, rating, and release
date.
◆ Search for movies by title.
◆ Ability to add new movies to the list.
◆ Ability to edit existing movie details.
◆ Ability to delete movies from the list.
◆ Ability to mark movies as favorites.
➔ Movie Details Page:
◆ Display detailed information about the movie, including description, actors,
director, genre, and rating.
Technical Requirements:
1. Frontend:
○ Implement the user interface using React.
○ Use React Router for navigation between pages.
○ Ensure a responsive design that looks good on various devices.
2. Backend:
○ Create a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.
○ Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing
movie data.
○ Use a database (e.g., MongoDB) to store movie information.
3. Database:
○ Design a database schema to store movie data (e.g., title, description, actors,
director, genre, rating, release date, image, etc.).
○ Use Mongoose for integration with MongoDB.
Extra Credit:
● Add advanced filters for the movie list (e.g., by genre, rating).
● Use Redux or React Query for state management in the application.Task:
